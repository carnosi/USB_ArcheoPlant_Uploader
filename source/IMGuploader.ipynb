    "- <b>Microscope</b> Select used microscope for images which shall be uploaded. Different manufacturers use different syntaxe and our parsed needs to know which approach should be used. Sofar are supported only ZEIS and KEYENS\n",
    "- <b>Mode</b> Operation mode of our scripts. <b>Pre Loader</b> prepares upload JSON for all images in target folder. Upload can be performed later or on another computer (if folder of this script is shared or uses exactly same paths for target images) <b>Uploader</b> uploades earlier prepared JSON to database. <b>All-in-One</b> Automatically prepares meta data and then uploads image to database. <b>IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE PRE LOADER AND AFTER THAT UPLOADER.</b> If some upload fails, it is not possible to restart it and progress has to be started from point 0.\n",
